                <p class="banffw">Gros Morne National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the west coast of Newfoundland, is a remarkable example of plate tectonics. The park's diverse landscapes were shaped by colliding continents and grinding glaciers over millions of years, exposing the Earth's mantle and creating unique fjords. Established as a park in 1973, it is recognized as a "textbook illustration" of geological history, providing a rare opportunity to see deep ocean crust and the planet's core rocks at the surface.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views in Gros Morne are dramatic and varied, from towering cliffs to barren highlands. The famous Tablelands are a striking sight, a flat-topped, rust-colored mountain of peridotite rock from the Earth's mantle that looks more like a desert landscape than a typical Newfoundland setting. The park also features spectacular glacier-carved freshwater fjords, such as Western Brook Pond, with sheer rock walls and cascading waterfalls. Hiking trails offer breathtaking views of the rugged coastline, lush forests, and the vast, beautiful wilderness.</p>
