                <p class="banffw">Cape Breton Highlands National Park, established in 1936, was the first national park in Atlantic Canada. The park was created to protect a representative example of the Maritime Acadian Highlands Natural Region. A third of the famous Cabot Trail, a scenic highway, winds through the park, offering access to the unique landscapes. The park is a rich blend of Mi'kmaq, Acadian, and Gaelic cultures, which have deep historical ties to the region.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views in Cape Breton Highlands are a stunning juxtaposition of mountains and sea. The park's terrain features a high, rolling plateau with steep river canyons that abruptly drop off to the rugged coastline below. From the numerous viewpoints along the Cabot Trail, you can see dramatic cliffs, sandy beaches, and sweeping ocean vistas of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The landscape offers a blend of Acadian and Boreal forests, and is a great place to spot wildlife like moose and bald eagles.</p>
