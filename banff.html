                <p class="banffw">Banff National Park, Canada's first national park, was established in 1885 following the discovery of hot springs by railway workers. This led to the development of the area by the Canadian Pacific Railway, who built grand hotels to attract tourists. The park's history is intertwined with the railway, which made the stunning mountain landscapes accessible to visitors and helped establish it as a world-renowned destination.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views in Banff are spectacular, defined by towering, snow-capped peaks and vibrant turquoise lakes like Lake Louise and Moraine Lake. These lakes get their unique color from glacial silt, creating a truly mesmerizing sight. Visitors can enjoy these incredible landscapes from easy-to-access viewpoints, by hiking the many trails, or simply by driving through the scenic mountain passes. The park offers an endless display of majestic mountains, pristine wilderness, and stunning natural beauty at every turn.</p>
