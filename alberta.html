            <p>Alberta is a province of contrasts, from the majestic peaks of the Canadian Rockies to the vast, golden prairies. It is often referred to as a "prairie province," but its western border is defined by some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the world, home to world-renowned national parks like Banff and Jasper. These parks offer a paradise for skiing, hiking, and wildlife viewing.</p>
            <p>Economically, Alberta is a powerhouse, a major contributor to Canada's oil and gas industry, but it's also a province of vibrant cities and cultural events. Calgary is known for its annual Stampede, a celebration of cowboy culture, while Edmonton, the capital, boasts the world's largest indoor shopping and entertainment complex. The province's rich history includes the stories of First Nations peoples, early European explorers, and the pioneers who shaped its unique identity.</p>
