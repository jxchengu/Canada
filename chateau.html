                <p class="banffw">The Fairmont Le Château Frontenac is an iconic hotel in Quebec City, built by the Canadian Pacific Railway and completed in 1893. Named after the former governor of New France, it was part of a series of grand "château-style" hotels built to promote luxury tourism and rail travel. The hotel’s history includes hosting the Quebec Conferences during World War II, where Allied leaders like Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt met to discuss war strategy. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of Quebec's rich history.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views from the Château Frontenac are among the most famous in Canada. Perched high on a cliff overlooking the St. Lawrence River, the hotel offers commanding vistas of the waterway and the surrounding city. Its own appearance is that of a fairytale castle, with its numerous towers, turrets, and copper roofs, making it a prominent and easily recognizable feature of the Quebec City skyline. This picturesque architecture and dramatic setting make it the most photographed hotel in the world.</p>
