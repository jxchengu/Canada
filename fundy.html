    <h1 class="can">Bay of Fundy</h1>

            <div class="alberta-text">
                <p class="banffw">The Bay of Fundy, located between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, is renowned for having the highest tides in the world. Its unique funnel shape, along with the resonant effect of the tides, causes massive volumes of water to surge in and out twice a day, with a tidal range that can exceed 16 meters (50 feet). The bay's history is deeply tied to its natural phenomenon, shaping the livelihoods of coastal communities through fishing, shipping, and now tourism. This geological marvel was also a finalist in the New 7 Wonders of Nature campaign.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views of the Bay of Fundy are constantly changing with the tides. At low tide, vast mudflats, sandbars, and the sea floor are exposed, revealing dramatic coastal rock formations like the famous Hopewell Rocks, often called "flowerpot rocks." At high tide, these formations become small islands as they are surrounded by water. The coastline itself is rugged and scenic, featuring towering cliffs, lush forests, and picturesque lighthouses. Visitors can witness this incredible tidal difference from coastal viewpoints, or from a kayak, where the dramatic transformation of the landscape is even more apparent.</p>
