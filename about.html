                        <h2 class="wasdwasdwasd">Transportation</h2>
                        <p class="transport">Canada's transportation network is a complex system designed to connect a vast country with a relatively small, spread-out population. Due to the immense distances, air travel is a popular and often necessary mode of transport for getting between major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. Canada has a well-developed network of airports, with Toronto Pearson (YYZ) and Vancouver International (YVR) being the busiest hubs. For overland travel, Canada boasts an extensive system of highways, with the Trans-Canada Highway serving as the primary east-west route, and a rail system primarily used for freight, but with a national passenger service provided by VIA Rail Canada.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Within cities, public transportation is a cornerstone of daily life. Major metropolitan areas like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have comprehensive systems that include buses, subways, and light rail. These systems are managed by different authorities in each city, with most offering day passes or monthly cards for convenience. For inter-city travel, bus services, such as FlixBus and other regional operators, offer an affordable way to travel between smaller towns and cities. Driving is also a popular option for tourists who wish to explore the country's scenic routes, offering the flexibility to visit remote areas and national parks that are not easily accessible by public transit.</p>

                        <p class="transport">Canada's four distinct seasons offer a different experience for every type of traveler. The summer months from June to August bring warm weather perfect for hiking, camping, and enjoying countless outdoor festivals. Fall, from September to October, is a beautiful time for seeing the brilliant colors of the changing leaves, especially in Eastern Canada. Winter, from December to March, transforms the country into a snowy wonderland for skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating, with opportunities to see the majestic Northern Lights in the northern territories. Spring, from April to May, is a time of renewal, famous for maple syrup production and blooming flowers.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Summer is the most popular time to visit Canada for a reason. With warm, sunny weather and long days from June to August, it's the perfect season for experiencing the country's vast outdoors. All national park trails are open, making it ideal for hiking in the Canadian Rockies, camping in the lush forests, or taking a scenic road trip along the coast. The warm temperatures allow for swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers, and the season's vibrancy is celebrated with countless outdoor festivals and events across the country.</p>

                        <h2 class="wasdwasdwasd">Currency</h2>
                        <p class="transport">Canada's official currency is the Canadian dollar ($). The Canadian dollar is divided into 100 cents (¢). The most common bills are $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Coins include the 5¢ (nickel), 10¢ (dime), 25¢ (quarter), $1 (loonie), and $2 (toonie). The $1 and $2 coins are nicknamed after the images on them: the loon on the one-dollar coin and the polar bear on the two-dollar coin. Canada stopped producing the 1¢ (penny) coin in 2013, and cash transactions are now rounded to the nearest five cents.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Tipping in Canada is an important part of the service industry, and it's customary in many situations. The average tip for good service in a sit-down restaurant is 15% to 20% of the pre-tax bill. Many modern payment terminals will offer these percentages as easy-to-select options. For other services like taxis, it's customary to tip around 10% to 15% of the fare. For hotel services, such as bellhops and housekeeping, a few dollars per bag or per day is appreciated. While tipping is not legally mandatory, it is a strong social expectation, as many service workers depend on tips to supplement their wages.</p>

                        <p class="transport">Canada is a winter sports paradise, with a wide array of activities to enjoy once the snow falls. Skiing and snowboarding are immensely popular at world-class resorts like Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia or those scattered throughout the Canadian Rockies. For a more leisurely activity, you can go ice skating on countless frozen lakes and ponds, including Ottawa's famous Rideau Canal, which transforms into the world's largest naturally frozen skating rink. Other popular pastimes include snowshoeing, dog sledding, and ice fishing.</p>
                        <p class="transport">In addition to skiing and snowboarding, Canada offers a wide range of unique winter activities. You can explore the silent, snow-covered landscape on snowshoes, which allow you to hike trails and wander through forests even in deep snow. For a truly unforgettable experience, try dog sledding, a traditional form of transport that lets you mush a team of huskies through the wilderness, especially popular in Quebec and the Yukon. For a quieter pastime, ice fishing on a frozen lake is a cherished tradition, where you can drill a hole through the ice and fish from a heated hut. These activities offer a deep connection to the Canadian winter and its natural beauty.</p>

                        <p class="transport">Hockey is more than just a game in Canada; it's a national obsession and a fundamental part of the country's identity. From the professional matches of the National Hockey League (NHL) to kids playing on frozen ponds in the winter, the sport is deeply woven into the fabric of Canadian life. It serves as a powerful source of national pride and a way for communities to connect, especially during the playoffs. Experiencing a hockey game, whether in a packed arena or a local community rink, is a quintessential Canadian experience that showcases the passion and energy that define the sport.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Lacrosse is Canada's official summer sport and holds a profound cultural significance. The game has a rich history with Indigenous peoples of North America, who developed and played it for centuries, often referring to it as the "Creator's Game." It is a fast-paced, physically demanding team sport played with sticks and a rubber ball. Today, it remains a popular sport in Canada, and watching a game is a great way to witness a sport with deep historical roots that is a cherished part of Indigenous and Canadian heritage.</p>

                        <p class="transport">With immense wild spaces, Canada offers fantastic opportunities for seeing animals in their natural habitat. In the mountains and forests of Western Canada, you might spot black bears or grizzly bears from a safe distance, while moose are common sightings in wooded areas across the country. On the coasts, whale watching is a major draw, with opportunities to see orcas and humpback whales on the Pacific coast and belugas in the Arctic.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Beyond the more common forest dwellers, Canada's vast northern territories are home to some of the world's most iconic wildlife. In places like Churchill, Manitoba, often called the "Polar Bear Capital of the World," you can safely view these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. The North is also where you'll find immense herds of caribou, and a variety of other unique arctic species like the elusive arctic fox, seals, and muskoxen. Seeing these animals thrive in the harsh, beautiful landscape of the Canadian North is a truly unforgettable and humbling experience for any traveler.</p>

                        <h2 class="wasdwasdwasd">Festivals</h2>
                        <p class="transport">Canada is home to a wide range of festivals and holidays, many of which are greatly valued for their cultural and historical significance. The most prominent national holiday is Canada Day, celebrated on July 1st. This day commemorates the anniversary of the Constitution Act of 1867, which united three British colonies into a single country. Across the nation, people celebrate with parades, free concerts, community barbecues, and spectacular fireworks displays. In the capital city of Ottawa, the celebrations on Parliament Hill are particularly grand, drawing tens of thousands of people for a day-long party that reflects the country's unity and national pride.</p>
                        <p class="transport">While not national holidays, several festivals are incredibly important for their cultural significance and attract national attention. The Calgary Stampede, held every July, is a world-renowned event that celebrates Western heritage and culture. Dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth," it began in 1912 and has since grown into a 10-day spectacle that includes a massive rodeo, chuckwagon races, live music concerts, and a parade. The festival is a vital part of Alberta's identity, symbolizing its cowboy roots and community spirit, and it draws over a million visitors each year.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Another culturally significant festival is the Quebec Winter Carnival, one of the world's largest winter carnivals. Held annually in Quebec City, the carnival celebrates the unique joys of winter and French-Canadian traditions. The event features a famous ice palace, night parades, snow sculpting competitions, and canoe races across the partially frozen St. Lawrence River.</p>

                        <h2 class="wasdwasdwasd">Local Etiquette</h2>
                        <p class="transport">Canadians have a reputation for being polite, and it's a stereotype that holds a lot of truth. You'll find that people are generally friendly and patient, and phrases like "sorry" and "thank you" are used frequently. It's common for people to hold doors for others, wait patiently in lines, and be generally considerate. Understanding these small but significant social cues can make your interactions with locals all the more pleasant.</p>
                        <p class="transport">Beyond the well-known politeness, there are a few other subtle but important aspects of Canadian etiquette. Punctuality is generally valued, so it's polite to be on time for appointments and social gatherings. While Canadians can be quite reserved in a first meeting, they are warm and welcoming once you get to know them. When dining out, it's customary to wait to be seated in a restaurant. If you're invited to someone's home, it's a nice gesture to bring a small gift, such as a bottle of wine or dessert, and to take off your shoes at the door. Canadians appreciate personal space, so avoid standing too close during a conversation.</p>
