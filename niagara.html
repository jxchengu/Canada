                <p class="banffw">Niagara Falls, a world-famous natural wonder, was formed over 12,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age when melting glaciers carved a path for the Niagara River. The falls are actually three separate waterfalls: the Horseshoe Falls (the largest on the Canadian side), and the American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls on the American side. The immense power of the falls has been harnessed for over a century for hydroelectric power, making it a vital source of electricity for the region. This history of engineering and daredevil stunts has made it a symbol of both natural grandeur and human ingenuity.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views of Niagara Falls are breathtaking and powerful. The constant, thundering roar of millions of gallons of water plunging over the cliffs is an immersive experience. The water's iconic turquoise color is a result of rock flour, or finely ground rock, suspended in the water. Visitors can get a close-up view of the spectacle from various observation decks, or by taking a boat ride that sails right into the mist at the base of the falls. On sunny days, the mist creates beautiful rainbows, adding to the picturesque scene.</p>
