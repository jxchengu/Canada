                <p class="banffw">The CN Tower, a defining landmark of Toronto, was constructed between 1973 and 1976 by Canadian National Railway. Its purpose was to solve a serious communications problem caused by the city's rapidly growing skyline in the 1960s, as the new high-rise buildings were interfering with television and radio signals. The tower was designed to be the tallest freestanding structure in the world, a title it held for over 30 years, and it was a symbol of Canadian industry and innovation.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views from the CN Tower are expansive, offering a breathtaking panorama of the city and its surroundings. From the observation decks, you can see the entire cityscape of Toronto, with its grid of streets, diverse neighborhoods, and the impressive waterfront of Lake Ontario. On a clear day, the view can extend for more than 160 kilometers, reaching as far as Niagara Falls and into New York State. The tower also features a unique Glass Floor and the EdgeWalk, a thrilling experience that allows visitors to walk hands-free on the outside ledge of the main pod, offering a one-of-a-kind perspective of the city below.</p>
