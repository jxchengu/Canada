                <p class="banffw">Parliament Hill in Ottawa became the center of Canada's federal government in 1857. The original Gothic Revival buildings were built starting in 1859, but the main Centre Block was destroyed in a fire in 1916. The new Centre Block, with its famous Peace Tower, was completed in 1927 and is now a powerful symbol of Canadian identity. Its timeless architecture and historical significance attract visitors from around the world, who come to witness its grandeur.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views from Parliament Hill are quite grand. You get a commanding look at the Ottawa River and the city of Gatineau, Quebec. The intricate architecture of the buildings themselves is a sight to see, and tours allow you to explore the beautiful Senate and House of Commons chambers. The view from the top of the Peace Tower offers a breathtaking panorama of the city and its surroundings.</p>
