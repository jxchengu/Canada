            <p>Quebec is the largest province by area and the only one with a French-speaking majority, giving it a unique European feel within North America. Its culture is a vibrant mix of French and North American influences, expressed through its music, cuisine, and festivals. The historic city of Quebec City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a living museum with its fortified walls and cobblestone streets.</p>
            <p>The province's largest city, Montreal, is a cosmopolitan hub known for its dynamic arts scene, world-class universities, and a thriving downtown. Beyond its cities, Quebec's landscape is defined by vast forests, the majestic St. Lawrence River, and the picturesque Laurentian Mountains. Its strong sense of cultural identity and history make it a fascinating and unforgettable place to visit.</p>
