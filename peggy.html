                <p class="banffw">Peggy's Cove, a small and picturesque fishing village in Nova Scotia, has a history deeply rooted in its maritime setting. While its exact naming is a subject of local folklore, one popular legend suggests it was named after the sole survivor of a shipwreck. Established in 1811, the village has long been a community sustained by the sea, with fishing remaining a key part of its identity to this day. The iconic Peggy's Point Lighthouse was built in 1915 and has become one of Canada's most beloved and photographed landmarks.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views at Peggy's Cove are a captivating blend of rugged natural beauty and quaint human settlement. The landscape is dominated by massive, smooth granite rocks, shaped by glacial movements and the constant pounding of the Atlantic Ocean. Clinging to this rocky shoreline are brightly colored fishing sheds and homes that give the village a postcard-perfect charm. From the vantage point of the famous lighthouse, you can see the powerful ocean waves crashing against the rocks. This dramatic and picturesque scenery makes Peggy's Cove a favorite destination for artists and photographers.</p>
