                <p class="banffw">The Columbia Icefield Skywalk is a recent addition to the Canadian Rockies, opening in 2014. It was designed to provide a safe and accessible way for visitors to experience the dramatic landscape of the Sunwapta Valley without needing to hike. The cantilevered structure, built into the side of a cliff, is an impressive feat of engineering. The Skywalk is part of the Columbia Icefield Discovery Centre, which offers educational displays about the area's geology, glaciology, and history.</p>
                <p class="banffw">The views from the Skywalk are truly breathtaking. The glass-floored platform extends 280 meters (918 feet) over the valley, offering a unique and dizzying perspective of the rugged canyon and a glimpse of the Athabasca Glacier in the distance. The panoramic vista includes towering mountain peaks, ancient glaciers, and the winding Sunwapta River far below. Interpretive displays along the walkway highlight the unique flora, fauna, and geological features of the subalpine environment, making it a place of both thrill and education.</p>
